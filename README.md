## Write Up
1. What you technologies you used and why (if you only used html, css, and js please explain any templates or frameworks you may have used i.e. bootstrap)
   
   Technologies I used were React, Bootstrap, Express, Node, and Webpack.  I decided to use these technologies to prove that I understand how to use a frontend framework like React and can manually configure my own development server using Webpack. Node and Express were for deployment and serving the project to heroku. I wanted to use Bootstrap for easy layout and styling.

2. Any struggles you faced when developing with technology you chose
   
   I definitely struggled a lot with layout and I was glad I used Bootstrap to help me with alignment and responsiveness. Another thing I struggled was using SVGs with React and Webpack- and this was because I was in my ```webpack.config.js``` I was using the ```url-loader``` to load my assets and so I had manually edit the svg files to give them the right coloring.
   
3. What you enjoyed the most and why

   I really liked figuring out the design, alignment, and responsiveness for each of my screens/pages. I would feel a huge rush of anticipation whenever I would make changes and then hit ```Save``` and then wait and watch to see if my understanding of CSS, Flexbox, MediaQueries, and Bootstrap were on point. It was so satisfying when I got it right and a lot of fun to bash my head (not literally) until I figured it out.
